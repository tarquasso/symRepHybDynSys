Learning symbolic representations of hybrid dynamical systems: Multi-Modal Symbolic Regression

Implementation of the MMSR algorith described in 
"Learning the Symbolic Representations of Hybrid Dynamical Systems" by Ly and Lipson http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v13/ly12a.html

For the Symbolic Regression, on which MMSR relies on, GPTIPS2 is used:
