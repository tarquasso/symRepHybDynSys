Unprocessed Capture Data is in:
"setX/<date> <time>.mat"

it contains a "History" struct variable that can only be evaluated when MotionHistory.m is in the same folder.

Running "parsingCaptureDataProject.m" generates out of this unprocessed data sets preprocessed files and places them in each sets folder:

"setX/<date> <time>_preprocessed.mat"
that contain:

General Parmeters:
angleDeg - angled in degree of the sliding table
mdisc - mass of puck
spread -  spread of the rubber band
zTouch - z value when puck first touches the rubber band

Capture Parameters:
The following are all cells, containing for each phase a vector:
timeStepsNC
thetaNC
thetadNC
thetaddNC
xNC
xdNC
xddNC
zNC
zdNC
zddNC
timeStepsIC
thetaIC
thetadIC
thetaddIC
xIC
xdIC
xddIC
zIC

zddIC

Note:
'NC' stands for no contact
'IC' stands for in contact
